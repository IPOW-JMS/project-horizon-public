# 🗺️ Project Horizon – Public Roadmap

This roadmap provides a high-level overview of milestones and development phases for the public-facing scaffolding of Project Horizon. Proprietary feature sets, market-specific logic, and product-level innovations are tracked in a separate internal document.

⸻

✅ Phase 1 – Core Infrastructure (Complete)
	•	Scaffold public repo with modular directory structure
	•	Add README, .env.example, LICENSE, .gitignore, PROPRIETARY.md
	•	Add GitHub Actions CI pipeline
	•	Add CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSES.md, CODEOWNERS
	•	Apply stealth-safe GitHub Topics and metadata

🏗️ Phase 2 – Public Dev Tools Expansion (In Progress)
	•	Add notebooks for embedding pipelines and chunking experiments
	•	Expand mcp_public/ with stateless test endpoints
	•	Provide CLI tools for testing, simulation, and embedding jobs
	•	Add issue templates and public documentation scaffolding (docs/)

🧪 Phase 3 – Open Experiments & Community Modules
	•	Enable community-submitted agents via PRs to mcp_public/
	•	Share safe-to-release test harnesses and datasets (if any)
	•	Add public benchmarking guides (non-RAG-specific)

🧱 Parallel Private Milestones (Omitted)
	•	Core agentic logic, tiering, prediction signals, and scoring are not tracked in this roadmap. See PROPRIETARY.md for those boundaries.
