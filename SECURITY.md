# 🔐 Project Horizon – Security Policy

This document outlines how to responsibly report security issues related to the public-facing components of Project Horizon.

We value community feedback and responsible disclosure practices. While much of our core logic is proprietary and hosted separately, this repository represents essential scaffolding for our development workflows and agent-ready infrastructure.
