üß± Project Horizon ‚Äì Architecture Overview (Public Version)

This document outlines the high-level technical architecture of Project Horizon‚Äôs public-facing scaffolding. It is designed to support contributor onboarding, open R&D, and future expansion of AI-native workflows.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Stack Overview

Layer	Tech	Purpose
Frontend	WeWeb	No-code UI builder with JS/native action support
Backend	Nhost	Postgres DB, auth, file storage, edge functions
GraphQL	Hasura	Role-aware API over Nhost DB with permissions
Agents	Python (modular)	Scaffolded agent endpoints with MCP wrapper pattern
CI/CD	GitHub Actions	Linting and test automation


‚∏ª

üß© Modular Components

backend/mcp_public/
	‚Ä¢	Stateless FastAPI services intended to wrap logic into composable, callable agent endpoints
	‚Ä¢	Examples: /ping, /simulate_embedding, /extract_metadata

frontend/weweb-scripts/
	‚Ä¢	Utility JS scripts for custom component behavior
	‚Ä¢	Integration hooks for anonymous onboarding, event triggers, etc.

graphql/
	‚Ä¢	Hasura metadata and RLS configuration
	‚Ä¢	Defines GraphQL schema and access roles for public, anonymous, etc.

scripts/
	‚Ä¢	CLI tools for embedding, metadata reset, or testing
	‚Ä¢	No business logic or proprietary algorithms

notebooks/experiments/
	‚Ä¢	Exploration notebooks (e.g., embedding chunking strategies, pipeline timing)
	‚Ä¢	Meant to be standalone and forkable

‚∏ª

üîê Private Interfaces (Omitted Here)

The following elements are excluded from this public architecture:
	‚Ä¢	Prompt design and agent chaining
	‚Ä¢	Tier progression, engagement telemetry, or RAG scores
	‚Ä¢	Proprietary embedding logic and scoring heuristics
	‚Ä¢	Signal ingestion, ranking, or market data logic

Refer to PROPRIETARY.md for boundary details.

‚∏ª

üß† Contribution Path
	‚Ä¢	Add new agents in mcp_public/ with FastAPI or Flask wrappers
	‚Ä¢	Use scripts/ to test transformations or embedding loads
	‚Ä¢	Use GitHub Actions to validate formatting and tests
	‚Ä¢	Fork notebooks or generate public-safe utilities
